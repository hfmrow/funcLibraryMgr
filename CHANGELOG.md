#### [1.1.4] 2021-04-02

#### Added

- Added the possibility to select (check boxes) or not the libraries to be scanned for search function.
- Auto refresh on select/deselect library
- Add popup to copy clipboard the import directory column content

#### Fixed

- The preview window does not bring to the foreground correctly (the main window stays on top), this is now fixed.

#### Changed

- Source code preview window can now be minimized/maximized to/from the task-bar.
- The display behavior in the found tab has changed, now with each search request the previous results are cleared and if nothing is found nothing is displayed.
- Repository name has changed to [https://github/hfmrow/func-lib-mgr](https://github.com/hfmrow/func-lib-mgr)  instead of `https://github.com/hfmrow/funcLibraryMgr`
